# External 3D Models
The 3D models in this folder are all made by the manufacturer. As such, I have not included them in the git release to not deal with licensing issues.

If you would like to have the 3D models, you must download them for the manufacturer. I have listed all of what are used in the next section, as well as how to get them.
